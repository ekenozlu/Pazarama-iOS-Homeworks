In this homework we focused on a mock food delivery application feed screen. It aims to built on static data and non-functional.

I used [this](https://www.behance.net/gallery/108639283/Meal-Monkey-Food-delivery-iOS-mobile-application) design as source
## App Contains
1. Custom NavigationBar
2. Custom Shaped TabBar with Custom Button
3. Functional Pull-down Button
4. Multiple CollectionView and TableView in one ViewController
5. StackView, ScrollView with all other elements built programmitacally

## I am currently working on (Until deadline):
1. Some functionality on app for better experience. (didSelect function for items, Context Menu for items)
